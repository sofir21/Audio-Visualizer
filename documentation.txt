Audio Visualizer by Sofia Rivas

2 Audio Effect nodes added: 
    Highshelf Filter & Lowshelf Filter

Sprites:
    Arrows class:
        This class is used to create & manage arrow objects.
        It takes in an image, direction, width and height.
        The drawArrow function inside it uses ctx.drawImage to draw the arrow.
        The updateArrow takes in a size, deltaTime, and scrollspeed, with which it moves the arrow up the screen and changes the size to the music.
    Kobeni class:
        This is the class in charge of the sprite of the girl dancing on the screen.
        The drawKobeni function draws ther with ctx.drawImage.
        The updateKobeni function picks a random number (0-4) that picks the next sprite and saves the last sprite used. By checking that the new random number isn't the same as the previous one, it makes it so it never repeats a dance frame.

JSON file:
    In my json file I included the title, the subtitle of the page, the starting state of the UI, as well as the title and filepath for every track. In main.js, I have a function that puts all of this information in the spot it's supposed to go.
